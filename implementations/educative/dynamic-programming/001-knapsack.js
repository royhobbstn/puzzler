// Introduction #
// Given the weights and profits of ‘N’ items, we are asked to put these items in a knapsack with a capacity ‘C.’ The goal is to get the maximum profit out of the knapsack items. Each item can only be selected once, as we don’t have multiple quantities of any item.

// Let’s take Merry’s example, who wants to carry some fruits in the knapsack to get maximum profit. Here are the weights and profits of the fruits:

// Items: { Apple, Orange, Banana, Melon }
// Weights: { 2, 3, 1, 4 }
// Profits: { 4, 5, 3, 7 }
// Knapsack capacity: 5

// Let’s try to put various combinations of fruits in the knapsack, such that their total weight is not more than 5:

// Apple + Orange (total weight 5) => 9 profit
// Apple + Banana (total weight 3) => 7 profit
// Orange + Banana (total weight 4) => 8 profit
// Banana + Melon (total weight 5) => 10 profit

// This shows that Banana + Melon is the best combination as it gives us the maximum profit, and the total weight does not exceed the capacity.

// Problem Statement #
// Given two integer arrays to represent weights and profits of ‘N’ items, we need to find a subset of these items which will give us maximum profit such that their cumulative weight is not more than a given number ‘C.’ Each item can only be selected once, which means either we put an item in the knapsack or we skip it.

let solveKnapsack = function (profits, weights, capacity) {
  const n = profits.length;
  if (capacity <= 0 || n == 0 || weights.length != n) return 0;

  const dp = Array(capacity + 1).fill(0);

  // if we have only one weight, we will take it if it is not more than the capacity
  for (let c = 0; c <= capacity; c++) {
    if (weights[0] <= c) dp[c] = profits[0];
  }

  // process all sub-arrays for all the capacities
  for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    for (let c = capacity; c >= 0; c--) {
      let profit1 = 0,
        profit2 = 0;
      // include the item, if it is not more than the capacity
      if (weights[i] <= c) profit1 = profits[i] + dp[c - weights[i]];
      // exclude the item
      profit2 = dp[c];
      // take maximum
      dp[c] = Math.max(profit1, profit2);
    }
  }

  // maximum profit will be at the bottom-right corner.
  return dp[capacity];
};

var profits = [1, 6, 10, 16];
var weights = [1, 2, 3, 5];
console.log(`Total knapsack profit: ---> ${solveKnapsack(profits, weights, 7)}`);
console.log(`Total knapsack profit: ---> ${solveKnapsack(profits, weights, 6)}`);
