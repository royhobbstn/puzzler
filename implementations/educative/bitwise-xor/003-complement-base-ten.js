// Complement of Base 10 Number

// Every non-negative integer N has a binary representation, for example, 8 can be represented as “1000” in binary and 7 as “0111” in binary.

// The complement of a binary representation is the number in binary that we get when we change every 1 to a 0 and every 0 to a 1. For example, the binary complement of “1010” is “0101”.

// For a given positive number N in base-10, return the complement of its binary representation as a base-10 integer.

function calculate_bitwise_complement(num) {
  // count number of total bits in 'num'
  let bit_count = 0;
  let n = num;
  while (n > 0) {
    bit_count++;
    n = n >> 1;
  }

  // for a number which is a complete power of '2' i.e., it can be written as pow(2, n), if we
  // subtract '1' from such a number, we get a number which has 'n' least significant bits set to '1'.
  // For example, '4' which is a complete power of '2', and '3' (which is one less than 4) has a binary
  // representation of '11' i.e., it has '2' least significant bits set to '1'
  let all_bits_set = Math.pow(2, bit_count) - 1;

  // from the solution description: complement = number ^ all_bits_set
  return num ^ all_bits_set;

console.log(`Bitwise complement is: ${calculate_bitwise_complement(8)}`);
// 7
console.log(`Bitwise complement is: ${calculate_bitwise_complement(10)}`);
// 5
